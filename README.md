# BNO055-Library-RP2040
This is a simple library that allows the communication from any RP2040 based board with the BNO055 sensor using I2C. This library
works best with the Arduino framework.

* Note that this library is under developement and will take time to be fully functional. *

As of 12/5/22, this library functions to retrieve acceleration measurements and gyroscope measurements. Future updates will include:
- An easy to use user guide explaining how the library works and how to use it
- The addition to get more data from other sensors in the BNO055 IMU
- A calibration function to increase the accuracy
